## [Description](#table-of-contents)
This is a deck-building assistant for “Magic: The Gathering” players. Its functionality allows users to select specific identifiers to further organize the collection into playable decks.

Users can log in, browse a catalog of existing cards, and sort desired cards into playable; so they can create balanced, thematic, and fun decks without needing a deep understanding of the entire card library.
